# Email-Marketing-Campaign-Dashboard
This repository showcases Python scripts used in generating fake data and the rest of the steps taken behind my personal Tableau project - Email Marketing Campaign Dashboard. It is based off the client work I have done. The dashboard is available [here]().

Dashboard - Overview:

## STEP 1. Setting up the IDE
First I have installed Anaconda Navigator onto my local machine and setted up a Spyder IDE with Python 3.9 in order to start generating the scripts. 

## STEP 2. Generating Scripts
Data is generated by three different scripts:
#### Script 1. Data generating script
This script uses faker library to generate fake email data inluding customer name, email name, sent dates etc as per below:

Full code available [here](https://github.com/Marius321/Email-Marketing-Campaign-Dashboard/blob/main/generate_emails.py).

#### Script 2. Filtering script 
The 1st script generates data with all customers receiving 4 emails, this script filters some of the emails out for certain groups of customers based on specified percentiles, so it mimics real world data better where different customers receive different number of emails.

Full code available [here](https://github.com/Marius321/Email-Marketing-Campaign-Dashboard/blob/main/filter_emails.py).

#### Script 3. Sankey script
This script transforms the data from the previous script in the format needed to build a Sankey Funnel Chart. Format available in the screenshot below. Script filters the data down to the month of August and to the year of 2023, later unioning the results to allow period filterability on dashboard.

Full code available [here](https://github.com/Marius321/Email-Marketing-Campaign-Dashboard/blob/main/sankey.py).

*Some of the scripts were written with the help of Chat GPT in order to speed up the process of generating scripts. 

## STEP 3. Setting up the Data Model
The datamodel for this dashbaord is realtively simple. It includes to tables with no real realtionship established between two of them. One is the sankey dataset, that feeds the sankey, and the other one is email metrics dataset that feeds the rest.

## STEP 4. Building Tableau dashboard
Sankey Funnel was build following the [blog](https://www.flerlagetwins.com/2019/11/sankey-funnel.html) by Ken Flerlage. I have also used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwV6FWAbPAM) Youtube tutorial to build gradient bar charts. The other Tableau functionality and features used.
- Parameter and Select Actions
- Navigation Buttons
- Gradient images created using Figma
- Custom number formatting to dsiplay up/down indicators

## Python Code Snippets
Generating Fake Data
```
name = faker.name()
account_number = faker.random_number(digits=8)
```
Selecting columns and filtering based on cerrtain values
```
customers_all_emails_in_2023 = df.groupby('name').filter(lambda group: all('2023' in date for date in group['sent_date']))
df_filtered_2023 = df[df['name'].isin(customers_all_emails_in_2023['name'])]
```
Defining custom functions
```
def filter_email_2(df):
    return df[df['email_name'].str.contains('Email 1|Email 2|Email 3')]
def filter_email_3(df):
    return df[df['email_name'].str.contains('Email 1|Email 2|Email 3|Email 4')]
```
For loops
```
for j in email_sequence:
    if name not in emails_sent:
        emails_sent[name] = [j]
    elif len(emails_sent[name]) < max_emails_per_person and j not in emails_sent[name]:
        emails_sent[name].append(j)
    else:
        continue
```
Merging and unioning data frames
```
merged = pd.merge(grouped_counts, model, on='Link')
df_union = pd.concat([data_2023, data_august], axis=0, ignore_index=True)
```
Pivoting data frames
```
df_pivoted = df.pivot(index='name', columns='email_name', values='email_name')
```
Applying functions to the data
```
num_emails = min(max_emails_per_person, 4)
len(emails_sent[name])
df[df['email_name'].str.contains('Email 2|Email 3')]
```
Changing the data types
```
percentile_index = int(total_customers * percentile) * 4
'sent_date': sent_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
```
Importing different Python libraries
```
import random
from faker import Faker
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```
Creating columns and assigning values
```
data_2023['Month/Year'] = "Year"
data_august['Month/Year'] = "Month"
```
Renaming columns
```
grouped_counts = grouped_counts.rename(columns={"Email 1": "Step 1", "Email 2": "Step 2", "Email 3": "Step 3", "Email 4": "Step 4"})
```
Reading and writing to Excel files
```
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Email Marketing\unfiltered_dataset.csv')
combined_result.to_csv(r'C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Email Marketing\filtered_dataset.csv', index=False)
```
## Shout outs and inpiration from:
The dashboard was inspired by Chimdi Nwosu viz #RWFD NYC Community Service Requests which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chimdi.nwosu/viz/RWFD-NYCCommunityServiceRequests/Overview). Below I outlined the steps taken to create this dashboard.
